# Article_Recommendation_System-with_Machine_Learning

A recommendation system is one of the applications of data science that is used by almost any application or website today. Many websites today use a recommendation system to recommend articles to their readers. For example, Medium.com and even the website youâ€™re currently reading this article on is also using a recommendation system to recommend articles to its readers. So, if you want to learn how to create an article recommendation system with machine learning, this article is for you. In this article, I will walk you through how to build an Article Recommendation System with Machine Learning using Python.
## Article Recommendation System 
There are many ways to create recommendation systems. To create an articles recommendation system, we need to focus on content rather than user interest. For example, if a user reads an article based on clustering, all recommended articles should also be based on clustering. So to recommend articles based on the content:

1. we need to understand the content of the article
1. match the content with all the other articles
1.  and recommend the most suitable articles for the article that the reader is already reading

For this task, we can use the concept of cosine similarity in machine learning. Cosine similarity is a method of building recommendation systems based on the content. It is used to find similarities between two different pieces of text documents. So we can use cosine similarity to build an article recommendation system. In the section below, I will take you through how to build an article recommendation system with machine learning using Python.
